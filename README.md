# S2VX

S2VX is a rhythm game where you click the squares to the beat. It is very inspired by [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) and is built with [osu! framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). S2VX uses a timeable, movable, scalable, rotatable camera system to place notes, allowing you to experience more interactive gameplay and motion sickness.
