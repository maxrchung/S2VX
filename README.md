# S2VX

S2VX is a rhythm game where you click some squares to some beats. It is heavily based on [osu! game](https://osu.ppy.sh) by [Dean peppy Herbert](https://ppy.sh) and is built with [osu! framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). S2VX uses a timeable, movable, scalable, rotatable camera system to place notes, allowing you to experience more interactive gameplay and motion sickness.
